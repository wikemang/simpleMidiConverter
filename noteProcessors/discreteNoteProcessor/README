I would say the biggest shortcoming of this approach is the lack of precision. When the original amplitude samples are split into intervals by time, frequency precision is lost if the interval is too small and time precision is lost if the interval is too big. Ofcourse, there are possible strategies to interpolate or categorize with heuristics, but correctness is still hard to see.
An idea would be to do 2 passes through the samples, one with a high interval and one with a low interval. The resulting shapes would be matched to each other with simple heuristics. I imagine that this idea would not do so well in practice because the errors introduced with low frequency precision or low time precision would be hard to accomodate for.
